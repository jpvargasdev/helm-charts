# Helm Charts

## Juan Vargas, Personal Helm Charts

Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helmâ€™s documentation to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

helm repo add jpvargasdev https://jpvargasdev.github.io/helm-charts
If you had already added this repo earlier, run helm repo update to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run helm search repo jpvargasdev to see the charts.
